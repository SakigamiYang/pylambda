## Lambda Calculus implemented on Python

---

In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also λ-calculus, is a formal system. 

It was introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s. Church used lambda calculus in 1936 to give a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem.

This repository contains lambdas with implemented lambdas and tests with pytest-based tests for it. 

Implemented:

1. Boolean operations
2. Natual numbers
3. Pairs
4. Combinators
5. Recursive functions
6. Signed numbers
7. Lists
